## About
Below Haven is a 2D platformer made by me and a team of 4 other students. 

## Contribution
I was mainly responsible for finding assets to use, animations for each sprite, and the scripts for the functionality of the game such as moving and jumping. I also worked on the documention for the project, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hn8h1RflfH6iyf2KvjhcLRMCp8uBVrdR?usp=sharing)

## Thoughts
Creating a 2D Unity project was a bit more challenging than creating a 3D Unity project. Some of the students I was working with were also new to Unity so it was a nice learning experience for all of us. If I had more time, I would add more levels, and make the core gameplay mechancics more fluid (AI and attacking interactions are a bit wonky).
